3d printing/laser cutting
      -lab64

Pat's ultrasonic sensor
      -just for conversion for inches / reference. Didn't use any of his code

Pseudo code for forward motion with wheel angle feedback
       -just followed the pseudo code, adding in limits for wheel throttles and fine tuning for my car

Line follower example code
     -ported the code pretty much directly
     
Notes: it would be super easy for me to make a line follower robot from this. 
Also it wouldn't be impossible for me to make a room rover robot (like a roomba) from here too.
