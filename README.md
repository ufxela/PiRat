3d printing/laser cutting

Pat's ultrasonic sensor
      -just for conversion for inches / reference. Didn't use any of his code

Pseudo code for forward motion with wheel angle feedback
       -just followed the pseudo code, adding in limits for wheel throttles and fine tuning for my car

Line follower example code
     -ported the code pretty much directly
     
Notes: it would be super easy for me to make a line follower robot from this. 
Also it wouldn't be impossible for me to make a room rover robot (like a roomba) from here too.

By far the hardest part of this assignment was visibility & understadning the hardware
Ex w/ visibility: for the past 5 hours, I've been trying to figure out why my backtracking wasn't working. I finally ifugred it out. It was an easy fix. But discovering what was going on was extremeely difficult because when the rat is solving the maze, it's very difficult to know what it's thinking. What I ended up doing was getting a few extra jumper wires and connecting the rat to my computer while it was solving the maze and walking along with the rat as it was solving the maze. super tiring on my arms. but it worked.
